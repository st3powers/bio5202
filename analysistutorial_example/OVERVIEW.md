Powers SM. A shiny application for rapid visualization of species occurrence databases.

Overview

Earth's biodiversity evolved over eons. Global change demands understanding of questions about the biosphere and all creatures in it. As a basic question: Where do different species occur and how are these distributions changing? On the applied side: How can we develop a tool that helps visualize, track, and forecast species distributions? In an increasingly data-rich world, much evidence exists to address diverse biological questions and communicate evidence-based stories. The Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) serves a large and growing compilation of species location records from mostly crowdsourced data sources such as iNaturalist (iNat) and eBird across a tremendous diversity of life worldwide, with over 3 billion location records and growing as of April 2025. A relatively recent R package called 'spocc' aims to make these species occurrence data more accessible and interoperable. To accelerate hypothesis formulation and evidence gathering relevant to changing species distributions, I used ChatGPT to support development of a simple Shiny application that successfully downloads and rapidly visualizes occurrence data from public databases for species chosen by users. To achieve this objective, I expanded on the ChatGPT conversation in example #7 "Write a shiny app" from the Supplementary of Merow et al. (2023), which uses R (R Core Team 2024). After 12 trial prompts, in response to a single prompt, one ChatGPT response stood out in providing a complete script with coding suggestions that mostly addressed my intents with technical accuracy. For example, prior to any code revisions, this script successfully generated a leaflet basemap visualization within a shiny instance. In a single afternoon, I was able to inspect and successfully revise the code, making it minimally functional in (spocc_shinyapp_minimal.R), and the associated test dashboard that it creates is hosted publicly at https://waterfolk.shinyapps.io/spocc_minimal. I then continued a series of minor revisions to the app over a few weeks, and the current dashboard is hosted at https://waterfolk.shinyapps.io/spocc. Large language models can accelerate development of research workflows in bioscience and other fields when supported through criticality, research questions, and reasonably specific goals and prompts.
